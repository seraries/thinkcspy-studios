## Walkthrough

In this walkthrough we'll practice the problem solving skill of breaking a large task down into smaller, subproblems and solving those on our way to finding the ultimate solution.

The problem we are assigned is the following:

    Write a function that takes a list of integers, along with a string that should be one of "positive" or "negative". Based on this second argument, print all of the integers that are positive or negative.

We'll break this problem into three levels of difficulty and solve each one in turn:

* **Level 1** Write a function that takes an integer and prints "positive" if it's positive, "negative" if it's negative, and prints nothing if it's 0.
* **Level 2** Write a function that takes a list of integers and prints only the positive ones.
* **Level 3** Write a function that takes a list of integers, along with a string that should be one of "positive" or "negative". Based on this second argument, print all of the integers that are positive or negative.
